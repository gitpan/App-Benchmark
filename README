NAME
    App::Benchmark - Output your benchmarks as test diagnostics

SYNOPSIS
        # This is t/benchmark.t:

        use App::Benchmark;

        benchmark_diag(2_000_000, {
            sqrt => sub { sqrt(2) },
            log  => sub { log(2) },
        });

DESCRIPTION
    This module makes it easy to run your benchmarks in a distribution's
    test suite. This way you just have to look at the CPAN testers reports
    to see your benchmarks being run on many different platforms using many
    different versions of perl.

    Ricardo Signes came up with the idea.

FUNCTIONS
    "benchmark_diag"
        Takes a number of iterations and a benchmark definition hash, just
        like "timethese()" from the Benchmark module. Runs the benchmarks
        and reports them, each line prefixed by a hash sign so it doesn't
        mess up the TAP output. Also, a dummy test is being generated to
        keep the testing framework happy.

        This function is exported automatically.
