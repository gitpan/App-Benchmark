VERSION
    version 1.102310

SYNOPSIS
        # This is t/benchmark.t:

        use App::Benchmark;

        benchmark_diag(2_000_000, {
            sqrt => sub { sqrt(2) },
            log  => sub { log(2) },
        });

DESCRIPTION
    This module makes it easy to run your benchmarks in a distribution's
    test suite. This way you just have to look at the CPAN testers reports
    to see your benchmarks being run on many different platforms using many
    different versions of perl.

    Ricardo Signes came up with the idea.

FUNCTIONS
  benchmark_diag
    Takes a number of iterations and a benchmark definition hash, just like
    "timethese()" from the Benchmark module. Runs the benchmarks and reports
    them, each line prefixed by a hash sign so it doesn't mess up the TAP
    output. Also, a dummy test is being generated to keep the testing
    framework happy.

    This function is exported automatically.

INSTALLATION
