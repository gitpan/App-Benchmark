This is the Perl distribution App-Benchmark.

## Description

This module makes it easy to run your benchmarks in a distribution's test
suite. This way you just have to look at the CPAN testers reports to see your
benchmarks being run on many different platforms using many different versions
of perl.

## Installation

App-Benchmark installation is straightforward. If your CPAN shell is
set up, you should just be able to do

    % cpan App::Benchmark

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

## Documentation

App-Benchmark documentation is available as in POD. So you can do:

    % perldoc App::Benchmark

to read the documentation online with your favorite pager.
